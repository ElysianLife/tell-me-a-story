    "Tell Me A Story (TMAS) is a content-based young children's book recommender using NLP that is derived from a Kaggle dataset of Goodreads.com book reviews. It was created so parents could input one of their child's favourite books and TMAS can recommend other similar books to read based entirely on key words in the book descriptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Please Note:** This is notebook 1 of 3 that were used to build the final product. This notebook includes all the steps I took when downloading and paring down the initial suite of eleven Goodreads.com data files from Kaggle; focused solely on children's books and resulting in a manageable starting point that is ready for cleaning and next steps. \n",

    "### Loading & Merging Datasets ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the original dataset did not classify books by genre or age, I attempted to identify books that are specifically for children by first researching whether the unique ISBN numbers that are allocated to each book would have a genre identifier but they do not. \n",
    "\n",
    "So instead, I decided to use page count as a rough identifier. I began by finding the average standard number of pages in children's books (according to authors and publishers), then pulled each of them out of the original Kaggle CSV files and merged them into a single dataset, specific to kids. \n",
    "\n",
    "Age Ranges & Book Classifications that I used for the purpose of this analysis:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Board Books (ages 0-2): 10 or less pages\n",
    "<li> Picture Books (2-3): Pages in multiples of 8 ranging from 16-32 pages in length\n",
    "<li> Early Readers (4-6): 32-48 pages (32+ for the purposes of this project)\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "And so, to simplify, I decided to split my data into only two categories using these age & book classifications as a guide (this step is done in notebook 2 of 3). \n",
    "\n",
    "In initially viewing the datasets and typical books/page counts, I started by only pulling in books over 50 pages but, after exporting those files to Excel just to scroll through the titles and do a contents check, I realized that the majority of that dataset was adult books using that page count. \n",
    "\n",
    "I tried again, using 40 pages as a threshold with similar results and upon closer review, I found that, in this dataset, anything over 38 pages is extremely difficult to capture and classify as a children's book by number of pages alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "I then had to isolate publisher names as a next step, however to reduce the number of publishers required for review, I limited my inital recommender dataset to target children under 6 years of age (according to publisher page count recommendations) and at a max of 38 pages. \n",
    "\n",
    "I understand I will be losing children's books that will be longer than 38 pages and will also capture some non-children's books in this initial sweep but this was the simplest way to start, in my opinion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes the steps I took in pulling the eleven .csv files from Kaggle, each with over 100,000 entries and then pulling out only (mostly) children's books using the above guidelines and assumptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "I then merged those into a single file and exported my finished dataset to a .csv file to be read into my EDA & Cleaning notebook for the next steps in this project. "

This dataset also includes many bilingual books, as parents often want to teach their kids multiple languages so I deemed any kids books, regardless of language, relevant but may need to screen these out at a later stage if it effects the performance of my recommender \n",
